# Project
This project was given in a worshop organised by Shape AI where we had to make a python program which prints time, date and weather forecast of any city mentioned by the user and then finally saving that output in a text file through the command line itself. It was a great fun being a part of it. I have attached my code here with named as "Weather_project".
